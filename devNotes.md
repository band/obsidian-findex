# development notes

### 2024-04-14:
 - possible short names for this list of files in a folder: `flistof`,
   `findex`  

 - working on figuring out how this code works; using
   "recent-files-obsidian" plugin for guidance (but, be careful of
   GPL)  
   
 - TODAYS UPDATE: able to gather `omittedPaths` info from Settings
   tab; use `loadData()` and `saveData()` functions  
   - still not sure how to store the `omittedPaths` data for future
     use  

 - next steps (a.k.a. TODOs):
  - change 'Paths' to 'Folders'
  - figure out how to get list of folders to ignore  
  - clean up `main.ts` so that I, at least, can understand how the
    code works  
  - then figure out if all the Obsidian Plug-in steps are worth it
